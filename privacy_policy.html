        <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
        <p>This privacy policy applies to the Oven Airfryer Convertor Chrome extension (hereby referred to as "the Extension") for mobile devices that was created by devherman@gmail.com (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. </p>
        <br>
        <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
        <p>The Extension collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your keyboard input</li>
            <li>Your mouse input</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Extension does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device, and no data will be transmitted to external services.</p>
        <br>
        <strong>Children</strong>
            <p>The Service Provider does not use Extension to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
            <div>
                <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children. The Service Provider 
                    encourages all children to never submit any personally
                    identifiable information through the Extension and/or Services.
                    The Service Provider encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor 
                    their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing 
                    their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Extension and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child 
                    has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Extension and/or Services, 
                    please contact the Service Provider (devherman@gamil.com) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions. 
                    You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing 
                    of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent 
                    or guardian to do so on your behalf).
                </p>
            </div>
        <br>
        <strong>Security</strong>
